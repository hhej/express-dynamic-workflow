# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-04)

**Core value:** The agent must transparently reason through fuel price, route, and shipping data to produce an accurate, explainable surcharge recommendation.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — tools-agent-nodes

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (tools-agent-nodes) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 5
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-18

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from requirement dependencies -- data first, tools second, graph third, UI fourth, polish last
- [Roadmap]: TOOL-06 (Pydantic models) and ORCH-06 (state schema) placed in Phase 1 as shared foundation
- [Roadmap]: TOOL-05 (Tavily), ORCH-07 (parallel), ORCH-09 (HITL) deferred to Phase 5 as differentiators that build on a working base
- [Phase 01]: Used pathlib relative to __file__ for all script paths to avoid cwd issues
- [Phase 01]: Zone multipliers 1.0/1.25/1.55 producing rate range 50-698 THB
- [Phase 01]: Used from __future__ import annotations for Python 3.9 compat with modern type hint syntax
- [Phase 01]: Exact cap boundary (== 0.15) treated as NOT capped -- only exceeding triggers cap
- [Phase 02]: pytest-httpx chosen over responses lib (C-01) — httpx-native mocking for fuel tool tests
- [Phase 02]: AgentState.reasoning_trace uses operator.add reducer (Pitfall 1) — parallel Send nodes append instead of overwrite
- [Phase 02]: FuelData.source kept as str (no Enum) per D-03 — open value-set for future sources
- [Phase 02]: TRAFFIC_RATIO_BUCKETS parsed from comma-separated env (defaults 1.1/1.3/1.5/1.8) per D-06
- [Phase 02]: ROUTE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS default 900s per D-07 — balances Google Maps quota vs freshness
- [Phase 02]: seeded_sqlite_path fixture copies real data/express.db — avoids test/prod seed drift
- [Phase 02]: [Phase 02]: Sentinel-safe SQL — '? < weight_max_kg' excludes 999 sentinel naturally; no NULL/special-case needed (C-02, D-13)
- [Phase 02]: [Phase 02]: @tool wrapper delegates to Phase 1 pure function (import alias _calc) — zero logic duplication, preserves existing 13 tests
- [Phase 02]: [Phase 02]: rate_tier format '<min>+kg' for top tier, '<min>-<max>kg' otherwise — human-readable, hides sentinel 999 from reasoning traces
- [Phase 02]: Plan 03 TOOL-02: lazy googlemaps client factory _client() enables clean mocker.patch.object seam — zero SDK-internal patching

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged LOW confidence on package versions -- must verify at install time (Phase 1)
- EPPO API response format undocumented -- may need reverse engineering (Phase 2)
- Gemini structured output reliability unknown -- test early in Phase 2
